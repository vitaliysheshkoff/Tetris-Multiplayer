/**
 * The {@code AudioCueInstanceEvent} class represents an event
 * in the life cycle of an {@code AudioCue} <em>instance</em>.
 * An {@code AudioCueInstanceEvent} is passed as
 * an argument to every class that implements the
 * {@code AudioCueListener} interface and is registered to
 * receive notifications about <em>instance</em> events.
 * <p>
 * An {@code AudioCue} supports concurrent plays of its media, where
 * the maximum number of concurrent plays is equal to the value
 * held in the final variable {@code AudioCue.polyphony}.
 * Each concurrent play is referred to as an <em>instance</em>.
 * Instance <em>events</em> mark the life cycle of
 * a single playing or playable instance as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>OBTAIN_INSTANCE: an instance is obtained from the pool
 * of available instances if the limit of allocated concurrent
 * instances is not exceeded</li>
 * <li>START_INSTANCE: an instance starts to play</li>
 * <li>LOOP: a instance that finishes playing restarts from the
 * beginning</li>
 * <li>STOP_INSTANCE: a playing instance is stopped (but can
 * still be restarted)</li>
 * <li>RELEASE_INSTANCE: an instance is released back into the
 * pool of available instances. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The information packaged in the {@code AudioCueInstanceEvent}
 * is contained in the following immutable fields:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>type</strong> - an {@code enum} designating the
 * nature of the event</li>
 * <li><strong>time</strong> - a {@code long} containing the time
 * of occurrence of the event, to the nearest millisecond</li>
 * <li><strong>source</strong> - the originating
 * {@code AudioCue}</li>
 * <li><strong>frame</strong> - a {@code double} containing the
 * sample frame (may be fractional) current at the time of the
 * event</li>
 * <li><strong>instanceID</strong> - an {@code int} used to
 * identify the {@code AudioCue} instance.</li></ul>
