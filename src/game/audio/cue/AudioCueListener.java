/**
 * A listener interface for receiving notifications of events
 * pertaining to an {@code AudioCue} and its playable or playing
 * instances. For a class to receive and act on these
 * notifications, it implements this interface, and a copy of
 * the class is registered with the {@code AudioCue} via the
 * following method:
 * <pre>    myAudioCue.addAudioCueListener(myAudioCueListener);</pre>
 * <p>
 * The execution of the implementing methods will occur on the
 * same thread that processes the audio data, and thus should
 * be coded for brevity in order to minimize extraneous processing
 * that might contribute to dropouts during playback.
