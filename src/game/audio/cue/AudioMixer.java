/**
 * {@code AudioMixer} combines the output of members of an
 * {@code AudioMixerTrack} collection into a single
 * {@code SourceDataLine} output line. Classes implementing
 * {@code AudioMixerTrack} can be added and removed from the
 * mix asynchronously, with the operation occurring at the
 * next buffer iteration. Source tracks must provide for the
 * return of an array of sound data frames whose length is
 * specified by the {@code AudioMixer}. Unlike an analog
 * mixer used in sound studios, the AudioMixer does <i>not</i>
 * provide functions such as panning or volume
 * controls. The only standard function is an equivalent
 * of a <em>mute</em> control, accessible via the {@code running}
 * variable. The mixer imposes a simple floor/ceiling of -1, 1,
